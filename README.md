# shaders
### Repo for my cs457 shaders work!  
- Project folders contain the complete shader files as well as a .glib file for use with glman.exe
- To use, move a set of shader files and .glib file into the root folder, run glmane.exe, and load the corresponding glib file
- Thanks to Mike Bailey for developing glman, a great way to test shader code!
